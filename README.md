# Here is the final project for Kevin Rozmiarek for GEOL 4700-5700-023:Special Geological Topic/Geological Topics Seminar

One note: You may need to create an "outputs" folder. Also, I haven't tested this locally so run on a CSDMS server if possible.

Requires bmi and landlab for running locally plus anything else found at the top of the ipynotebook
